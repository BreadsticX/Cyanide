How to build the dylib?
after opening the source or xcode file press cmd + b so it says it will succeded 
- Then get the dylib of the build folder and put it into your cheat folder and launch it.
If it doesnt work contact me on my discord.

Hello, im Breadstick, I added a few mods in here, 
check the consle when injected to see all added
Im not taking any work from mani and claiming it as mine!
i just changed some code. ;)

EVERYTHING IN THIS VERSION WORKS!!

To get it to work put libvHook.dylib in a new folder after you build it, 
then put bootstrap.dylib and osxinj in the same folder, after you have done that put that folder on the desktop of your mac,
open terminal and type "cd desktop" then "cd YOURFOLDERNAME" finally type "sudo ./osxinj csgo_osx64 libvHook.dylib"
bootstrap and osxinj can be found in the root of Cyanide-Master
